# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis
Project Title: Road Accident Dashboard (2021-2022)

Project Overview: This project focuses on building a Road Accident Dashboard using Power BI to analyze accident data from 2021 and 2022. The goal is to provide key stakeholders with actionable insights regarding accident severity, casualties, and trends, helping to enhance road safety and prioritize resources.

Key Metrics and Visualizations:

Primary KPIs:
Total Casualties and Accidents for the current year.
Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth in total casualties and accidents.
Casualties by Accident Severity with YoY growth.
Secondary KPIs:
Total casualties by Vehicle Type for the current year.
Monthly Trend: Visualizing a comparison of casualties for the current year vs. the previous year.
Casualties by Road Type: Analysis of total casualties by different road types.
Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night for the current year.
Total Casualties and Accidents by Location: Insight into location-based accident statistics.
Features:

Interactive Filters: Allow users to explore accident data by time, location, and accident type.
YoY Growth Calculations: Show trends and growth in accident statistics over time.
Visual Comparisons: Use line and bar charts to illustrate differences between 2021 and 2022.
Skills Utilized:

Data Modeling: Structured accident data for trend analysis.
DAX Calculations: Implemented for YoY growth metrics and accident statistics.
Power BI Visualizations: Provided clear, actionable insights through interactive dashboards.
This dashboard is a critical tool for authorities to monitor accident trends and make data-driven decisions to enhance road safety and reduce casualties.
